We have released a [workshop tutorial](https://github.com/SynBioHub/synbiohub3/wiki/Workshop-Instructions). The workshop shows how to setup a local instance of SynBioHub, utilizing the SynBioHub API to interface with pySBOL, and how to setup a simple plugin in SynBioHub.

We appreciate any feedback or suggested improvements you have. If you have an error please see reporting an error. If you would like help with something or to discuss a potential feature please see the mailing lists.
