### General
The docker-compose files in this repository represent various configurations for deploying SynBioHub.
The files can be layered with Docker Compose's [multiple file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/#specifying-multiple-compose-file) capabilities. 

The base configuration, described with `docker-compose.yml`, is simply SynBioHub, its graph database Virtuoso, and an autohealer.

To run the base configuration:

1. Before trying to run SynBioHub locally on your PC, Make sure that you've Git and Docker installed.

  * Git:-
    
       For MacOS, click [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).
    
       For Windows OS, click [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
    
       For Linux/Unix OS, click [here](https://git-scm.com/download/linux).
    
    
  * Docker:-
       
       For MacOS, click [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).
    
       For Windows OS, click [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).
    
       For Linux OS, click [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
       

2. Open the terminal/cmd.

3. Navigate to the directory where you want to install SynBioHub.

   For Mac/Linux/Windows OS use the following command to navigate: 
   
   	`cd directory_name`
   

4. Subsequently, enter the following command into your terminal:

	`git clone https://github.com/synbiohub/synbiohub-docker`

5. Then, enter the following commands to start the local instance of SynBioHub:

  * For Mac/Linux/Unix: There are 2 ways of running the local instance of SynBioHub for these Operating Systems. They're stated as follows:

      
     1st Method:
        
	`docker-compose --f ./synbiohub-docker/docker-compose.yml up`
	
     2nd Method:
          
       This has been explained [here](https://synbiohub.github.io/installation/#with-sbolexplorer). 
   * For Windows OS:
   
   Enter the following command into the command prompt:
   
 `docker-compose --file ./synbiohub-docker/docker-compose.yml --file ./synbiohub-docker/docker-compose.explorer.yml up`
   
6. In your browser search for localhost:7777 and it'll take you to a setup page when you'll run it for the very first time.

   [In case of Linux OS, if you face any permission errors, then simple insert **sudo** before every statement]
  	

### With SBOLExplorer
To add [SBOLExplorer](https://github.com/michael13162/SBOLExplorer), add the `docker-compose.explorer.yml` to the main docker-compose, i.e. for step 3 run the following command:

    `sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`

 
    `docker-compose --f ./synbiohub-docker/docker-compose.yml -f ./synbiohub-docker/docker-compose.explorer.yml up`

### With Plugins
To add plugins to the configuration, change the command mentioned in step 3 to: 

`docker-compose --f ./synbiohub-docker/docker-compose.yml -f ./synbiohub-docker/docker-compose.explorer.yml -f ./synbiohub-docker/docker-compose.<Plugin 1 File Name>.yml -f ./synbiohub-docker/docker-compose.<Plugin 2 File Name>.yml up`

Note that all plugins are added before the `up` and each is preceeded by `-f `. For example, to run the configuration with the VisualIgem plugins and the VisualSeqviz plugin run:

`docker-compose --f ./synbiohub-docker/docker-compose.yml -f ./synbiohub-docker/docker-compose.explorer.yml -f ./synbiohub-docker/docker-compose.pluginVisualIgem.yml -f ./synbiohub-docker/docker-compose.pluginVisualSeqviz.yml up`


## Plugins

The sortable plugins table can be found [here](https://synbiohub.github.io/synbiohub-docker/#plugins).
